# RC4 Key Recovery Attacks
A key recovery attack against a mock encryption scheme I've called RC4-CTR. It builds a block cipher using poorly borrowed ideas from AES's counter mode, and in doing so, introduces a key recovery attack. It's similar to the WEP attack used by tools such as aircrack-ng but the initilisation vector is placed before the long term key.

This is a chosen-plaintext attack that recovers the private key in around 100,000 blocks. It works when ephemeral keys are generated by concatenating a public nonce before the long-term key (ala Section 4.3 in "Attacks on the RC4 stream cipher" by Andreas Klein). And should be generalisable to similar constructions. 

See `solve.py` for more information on how it works. I'm planning on putting up an oracle server to mount this attack against.
